Optimizing algorithms for a mathematical problem I've been trying to solve.

A wise, noble bacteria King rules over his bacteria vassals. In his lands are N clusters of bacteria, each with 1 bacterium in them. On day 1, a single cluster divides, doubling its population, then sends half its population to a single other cluster. This leaves the original cluster with the same population. This continues day by day, until each cluster has sent its population to each other cluster exactly once. On the last day, each cluster doubles once again, and sends half its population to the king bacterium. In what order should the king instruct his clusters to send each other bacteria, to maximize his final population? What is his final population, in terms of N?
